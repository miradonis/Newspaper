            <h3>Shattering cookware</h3>
            <p>
                More than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware. Hot handles can burn and sometimes glass
                cookware can shatter.

            <h3>Knife cuts</h3>
            <p>
                Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen type) affected more than 350,000
                people in 2012,
                according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are actually more dangerous than
                sharp ones, because
                they require more pressure to use and their worn edge can cause the knife to slip off food and into
                your fingers.

            <h3>Cooking fires</h3>
            <p>
                Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five reported home fires. Unattended cooking
                equipment
                accounts for one in three fires, and half are ignited by fat, grease, oil, or related substances,
                according to the
                National Fire Protection Association.

            <h3>Contact Burns From Equipment</h3>
            <p>
                The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on an open fire like our ancestors did; we have
                a nifty box
                that keeps the heat contained and cooks our food to perfection. But all that heat combined with metal
                components and
                cookware leads to loads of burns. Quick tips (which are obvious, but good to keep in mind): Always use
                oven mitts,
                replace them when they’re old; don’t use a wet towel as an oven mitt; don’t reach your arm in to check
                baked goods, pull
                out the rack to test;

            <h3>Death to the Pathogens</h3>
            <p>
                The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking in your food. The Centers for Disease
                Control and
                Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year roughly one in six Americans (or 48 million people) gets sick,
                128,000 are
                hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. The top five culprits sending Americans to the
                hospital are
                salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii and E.coli – but much can be done in terms
                of proper food
                handling, cooking and storage to help prevent these pathogens from causing illness.
